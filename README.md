# Howdy Hey! ðŸ‘‹
It's me, **Lavender (they/them/theirs)** and this is my GitHub Profile! I'm a fullstack developer, designer, and I am currently attending college somewhere in San Diego County. I would consider myself to be interested in some fun silly little projects, or even building online communities! I do tend to pick up random projects here and there in my free time, so keep an eye out ;3
